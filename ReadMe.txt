This is a website that is created to help accelerate the PLU numbers training of new employees, which are required for the job.
 
  The website is made of 3 Levels:
-The first level being the easiest consisting of multiple choice answers.
-Second level being a bit more trickier requiring the user to enter the whole PLU but he is supplied with HINTS.
-And the third level being a replica of the first level is a Quiz level. Where the user has no hints and a correct and incorrect answer counter.
